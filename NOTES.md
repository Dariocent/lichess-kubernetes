# Choices to be made

- How to implement MongoDB (statefulsets vs operators)
- How to serve static content (CDN best way but overengineered, build static content directly into the nginx container)

# Other notes

- Include original architecture diagram from lichess repo, maybe do another diagram with the updated architecture

- Domain could be lichess-k8s.cantella.dev

- Phases: Analysis of the current architecture, choose important functionality to migrate first
